# Node.js client

In this folder we create a basic COAP client that attempts to send a POST
request to the `/echo` endpoint, and prints the result to stdout.

## Dependencies

This uses NPM, and the `node_modules` folder is not committed so you'll have to
do `npm install` to pull them down.

## Running the client

Run the client using:

```bash
$ node index.js
```
