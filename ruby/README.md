# Ruby client

In this folder we create a simple ruby client, hit the `/pulse` endpoint, and
then send a request to the `/echo` endpoint. We print out any responses we get
back.

## Dependencies

We are using bundler to pull down any dependencies, so if you change into the
ruby folder and run:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Running the client

You can run the client like:

```bash
$ ruby client.rb
```
